# HireWire - Master Goals & Strategy

## Original Goals (From Resume Job Search)

The following goals were identified during resume/job search automation work that led to the HireWire concept:

---

## 1. Resume/Cover Letter Management - 10 Categories

### Categories
1. Software Engineering (Full Stack, Frontend, Backend)
2. AI/ML Engineering (Machine Learning, Data Science)
3. Data Center Operations (Infrastructure, Network Engineering)
4. IT Management (Technical Leadership, IT Operations)
5. Development Management (Engineering Management, Technical PM)
6. Hardware Engineering (Systems, Embedded)
7. DevOps/SRE (Platform Engineering, Infrastructure as Code)
8. Blockchain/Web3 (Smart Contracts, DeFi)
9. Security Engineering (InfoSec, Application Security)
10. Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, Multi-cloud Solutions)

### Validation Requirements (Per Category)

**Experience Accuracy:**
- Years of experience matches actual job history
- Technology stack matches real usage in positions
- Seniority level matches role responsibilities
- Industry experience supported by companies/projects
- Certifications/education support claimed expertise

**Skills & Experience Claims:**
- Only list technologies with real project experience
- Proficiency levels are honest (Expert/Working/Learning)
- No exaggerated metrics (users, revenue, scale)
- Accomplishments are specific and measurable
- Years with each technology are accurate

**Scope & Process Understanding:**
- SDLC processes match actual work experience
- Architecture decisions show understanding of trade-offs
- Scaling challenges are from real experience
- Team collaboration reflects actual team sizes
- Project lifecycles match actual timelines

**Understanding → Accomplishments Connection:**
- Each technical skill has corresponding achievement
- Process improvements have measurable outcomes
- Architecture decisions have business impact
- Leadership claims supported by team size/scope/outcomes
- Problem-solving includes context → solution → result

**Key Terms → Position History Alignment:**
- Job title keywords match actual responsibilities
- Technology keywords appear in relevant positions
- Industry terms match actual company domains
- Role keywords match actual authority level
- ATS keywords naturally integrated, not stuffed
