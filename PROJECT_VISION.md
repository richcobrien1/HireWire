# HireWire - Project Vision

## Tagline
**"Get hired on the wire" - Live hiring, real connections**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Job Platforms Are Broken

**For Candidates:**
- Send 100+ applications into a black hole
- 2-3% response rate
- No feedback, no connection
- Job hunting feels like depressing work
- Can't tell if anyone even read your resume

**For Companies:**
- Get 500 applications, 490 are spam
- Spend hours screening unqualified candidates
- ATS systems only do keyword matching
- Miss great candidates who don't keyword-stuff
- Hiring takes months, costs thousands

**For Everyone:**
- No actual connection happens
- Just resume dumps and auto-rejects
- Marketplace exists but matching is broken
- Communication never starts
